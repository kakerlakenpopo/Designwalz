text_1: Design Walz is a way of continuing to share knowledge while traveling around the country, continent or world.
----
text_2: By working in several agencies and companies you are able to build a sustainable network with meaningful contacts. Going on a Walz means expanding your comfort zone while focusing on learning and your creativity. A Walz is based on trust and respect between all participants.
----
text_3: We adapted the idea of the Walz from an old craftsman tradition and want to implement it for Designers. One of the obstacles is the missing contact to a network that could support people on their Walz. So we want to build that community.
